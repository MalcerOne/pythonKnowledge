personal-development,A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment,Dr. Rajagopal Raghunathan,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of lifeâs biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.

How valid are our theories?

Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. 

Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. 

For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email. 

The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:
      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),
      - Ed Diener (âDr. Happinessâ),
      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),

By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:
      - Why arenât the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they couldâor shouldâbe
      - What are the â7 Deadly Happiness Sinsâ that even the smart and the successful commit?, and
      - What are the â7 Habits of the Highly Happyâ and how can you implement them in your life?

By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","452,069","5,688"

personal-development,De-Mystifying Mindfulness,Chris Goto-Jones,"Interest in meditation, mindfulness, and contemplation has grown exponentially in recent years.  Rather than being seen as mystical practices from ancient Buddhism or esoteric philosophy, they are increasingly seen as technologies rooted in evidence from psychology and neuroscience.  Mindfulness has become the basis for numerous therapeutic interventions, both as a treatment in healthcare and as a means of enhancing well-being and happiness.  For millions around the world, mindfulness has become a life-style choice, enhancing and enriching everyday experience. Mindfulness is big business.But, what actually is mindfulness?  Is it really good for you?  Can anyone learn it?  How can you recognize charlatans? Would you want to live in a mindful society, and would it smell like sandalwood?  What does it feel like to be mindful?  Are you mindful already, and how would you know?

Evolving from the popular Honours Academy course at Leiden University, this innovative course combines conventional scholarly inquiry from multiple disciplines (ranging from psychology, through philosophy, to politics) with experiential learning (including specially designed âmeditation labs,â in which youâll get chance to practice and analyze mindfulness on yourself).  In the end, the course aims to provide a responsible, comprehensive, and inclusive education about (and in) mindfulness as a contemporary phenomenon.

During the production of this course, we have been supported by Willem Kuyken, Director of the University of Oxford Mindfulness Centre, and Stephen Batchelor, co-founder of Bodhi College.  And we gratefully acknowledge the contributions made by Mark Williams, co-developer of Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), and Rebecca Crane, Director of the Centre for Mindfulness Research and Practice at the University of Bangor. We have recently added expert advice from Dawn Scott (Spirit Rock & Barre Centre for Buddhist Studies), Sydney Spears (University of Kansa), Elisabeth Stanley (Georgetown University), Susan Woods (Centre for Mindfulness Studies), Patricia Rockman (University of Toronto) and Jeff Corntassel (University of Victoria).

""A deep and profound dive into the ethical, social, psychological, and philosophical implications of modern-day mindfulness practice. The course is not for the faint of heart, perhaps, but it is also full of practical, guided exercises for the uninitiated! Thank you for redefining my relationship to Mindfulness in a completely new and thought-provoking way"" 28 april 2021

""The course enabled me to explore the mindfulness construct at its deeper lever from philosophical, psychological and political lenses. The mindfulness labs were very useful in practicing the skills of being mindful."" 23 nov 2018

""i took this course after a period of time when I was trying to practice mindfulness and meditation, but with doubtful success. The course answered many questions to me, and I needed that to keep me motivated. It really helped me understand the origins and, more importantly, benefits of mindfulness practice and made me persist in my attempts. I'm really glad I took the course, I find it interesting, well taught and very useful for all those seeking deeper explanation in why trying mindfulness."" 9 Oct 2018

""I have taken other courses in other online platforms. However, this has been one of the best courses I have found online."" 3 Oct 2018

""I really like the invitation to us, the learners, to rethink our preconceptions and beliefs, and then make our own judgement about mindfulness. The overall tone was very friendly and open, resources very useful."" 12 Dec 2017","206,929","1,476"

Each of us is dealt a different hand in life, but we all face similar questions when it comes to human behavior: What leads us to like one person and dislike another? How do conflicts and prejudices develop, and how can they be reduced? Can psychological research help protect the environment, and if so, how? This course offers a brief introduction to classic and contemporary social psychology, covering topics such as decision making, persuasion, group behavior, personal attraction, and factors that promote health and well-being.

Our focus will be on surprising, entertaining, and intriguing research findings that are easy to apply in daily life. The course will also draw from the websites of Social Psychology Network, the world's largest online community devoted to social psychology. I hope you'll join me for this course, have fun, and learn some useful information that enriches your life.","546,386","4,462"
personal-development,A Life of Happiness and Fulfillment,Dr. Rajagopal Raghunathan,"What are the determinants of a happy and fulfilling life?This is surely one of lifeâs biggest questions, and a question that has interested many of our ancestors. Buddha famously gave up his kingdom in search of happiness. Several Greek philosophers (from Aristotle to Epicurus and Plato to Socrates) had their own views on what it takes to be happy. And of course, we all have our own theories about happiness too.

How valid are our theories?

Until recently, if you wished for an answer to this question, you would've been forced to base it on discussions with spiritual leaders. Or, if you were lucky, you could've based it on late-night (and perhaps intoxicant-fueled) conversations with friends and family. Happily, all that has changed now. Over the past decade-and-a-half, scientists have gotten into the act big time. We now have a pretty good idea of what it takes to lead a happy and fulfilling life.

This course, based on the award-winning class offered both at the Indian School of Business and at the McCombs School of Business at The University of Texas at Austin, developed by Prof. Raj Raghunathan (aka ""Dr. Happy-smarts"") draws content from a variety of fields, including psychology, neuroscience, and behavioral decision theory to offer a tested and practical recipe for leading a life of happiness and fulfillment. 

Although not mandatory, reading Prof. Raj's forthcoming book, titled If you're so smart, why aren't you happy? can help you review and assimilate the material covered in this book at your leisure. 

For Coursera learners alone, the hardcover version of the book is available for a deep discount of 50%, plus shipping and handling. You can order the hardcover for 50% off by writing to Aaron at: Aaron@800ceoread.com. Please mention that you are a student of the ""coursera happiness course"" in your email. 

The course will feature guest appearances by several well-known thought leaders, including:
      - Dan Ariely (author of Predictably Irrational and, soon to be released, Irrationally Yours),
      - Ed Diener (âDr. Happinessâ),
      - Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (author of Flow),

By taking this course, you will discover the answers to questions such as:
      - Why arenât the smart-and-the-successful as happy as they couldâor shouldâbe
      - What are the â7 Deadly Happiness Sinsâ that even the smart and the successful commit?, and
      - What are the â7 Habits of the Highly Happyâ and how can you implement them in your life?

By the end of the course, I expect students who have been diligent with the lectures and exercises to not just gain a deeper understanding of the science of happiness, but to also be significantly happier.","452,069","5,688"
personal-development,Introduction to Mathematical Thinking,Dr. Keith Devlin,"Learn how to think the way mathematicians do â a powerful cognitive process developed over thousands of years.Mathematical thinking is not the same as doing mathematics â at least not as mathematics is typically presented in our school system. School math typically focuses on learning procedures to solve highly stereotyped problems. Professional mathematicians think a certain way to solve real problems, problems that can arise from the everyday world, or from science, or from within mathematics itself. The key to success in school math is to learn to think inside-the-box. In contrast, a key feature of mathematical thinking is thinking outside-the-box â a valuable ability in todayâs world. This course helps to develop that crucial way of thinking.","414,212","2,443"

personal-development,Learning How to Learn: Powerful mental tools to help you master tough subjects,Barbara Oakley,"This course gives you easy access to the invaluable learning techniques used by experts in art, music, literature, math, science, sports, and many other disciplines. Weâll learn about how the brain uses two very different learning modes and how it encapsulates (âchunksâ) information. Weâll also cover illusions of learning, memory techniques, dealing with procrastination, and best practices shown by research to be most effective in helping you master tough subjects.  Using these approaches, no matter what your skill levels in topics you would like to master, you can change your thinking and change your life. If youâre already an expert, this peep under the mental hood will give you ideas for turbocharging successful learning, including counter-intuitive test-taking tips and insights that will help you make the best use of your time on homework and problem sets. If youâre struggling, youâll see a structured treasure trove of practical techniques that walk you through what you need to do to get on track.

personal-development,Successful Negotiation: Essential Strategies and Skills,George Siedel,"We all negotiate on a daily basis. On a personal level, we negotiate with friends, family, landlords, car sellers and employers, among others. Negotiation is also the key to business success. No business can survive without profitable contracts. Within a company, negotiation skills can lead to your career advancement. I hope that you will join the hundreds of thousands of learners who have made âSuccessful Negotiationâ one of the most popular and highly-rated MOOCs worldwide.  In the course, youâll learn about and practice the four steps to a successful negotiation: 

   (1) Prepare: Plan Your Negotiation Strategy 

   (2) Negotiate: Use Key Tactics for Success 

   (3) Close: Create a Contract 

   (4) Perform and Evaluate: The End Game 

To successfully complete this course and improve your ability to negotiate, youâll need to do the following: 

(1) Watch the short videos (ranging from 5 to 20 minutes). The videos are interactive and they include questions to test your understanding of negotiation strategy and skills. You can speed up or slow down videos to match your preferred pace for listening. Depending on your schedule, you can watch the videos over a few weeks or you can binge watch them. A learner who binge-watched the course concluded that âItâs as good as Breaking Bad.â Another learner compared the course to âHouse of Cards.â  Both shows contain interesting examples of complex negotiations!

(2) Test your negotiation skills by completing the negotiation in Module 6. You can negotiate with a local friend or use Discussions to find a partner from another part of the world. Your negotiation partner will give you feedback on your negotiation skills. To assist you with your negotiations, I have developed several free negotiating planning tools that are related to the course.  These tools and a free app are available at http://negotiationplanner.com/ 

(3) Take the final exam. To successfully complete the course, you must answer 80% of the questions correctly. The exam is a Mastery Exam, which means that you can take it as many times as you want until you master the material.

Si bien el curso presenta ideas que pueden ser Ãºtiles para actores educativos en general, los ejemplos y estrategias estÃ¡n particularmente dirigidos a docentes de contextos escolares.

Teniendo en cuenta que formar para el ejercicio activo, crÃ­tico y constructivo de la ciudadanÃ­a es una necesidad prioritaria en los contextos actuales, el curso presenta los temas, asuntos, problemas y conceptos indispensables para promover el desarrollo de competencias ciudadanas de niÃ±os, niÃ±as y jÃ³venes en formaciÃ³n. Para lograrlo se propone analizar la ciudadanÃ­a a travÃ©s de la ampliaciÃ³n progresiva de sus contextos de aplicaciÃ³n: el individual, el interpersonal, el grupal, el comunitario y el mundial.

Adicionalmente a estas comprensiones conceptuales, el curso ofrece la oportunidad de desarrollar capacidades didÃ¡cticas en los participantes, quienes podrÃ¡n diseÃ±ar estrategias pedagÃ³gicas orientadas al desarrollo de las competencias ciudadanas de sus educandos y a la construcciÃ³n de ambientes democrÃ¡ticos de aprendizaje que favorezcan dicho desarrollo.

Las actividades propuestas en el curso estÃ¡n diseÃ±adas de tal forma que los participantes puedan apropiarse de herramientas conceptuales y pedagÃ³gicas a partir del principio de âaprender haciendoâ, en donde permanentemente estarÃ¡n poniendo en prÃ¡ctica dichos aprendizajes. Este es un curso ampliamente flexible que permite a los participantes escoger diferentes rutas de aprendizaje para concentrarse en los contenidos de su interÃ©s y/o en el nivel de profundizaciÃ³n que quieren alcanzar para cada uno de ellos. Es asÃ­ como el curso permitirÃ¡, especialmente a docentes escolares, desarrollar y fortalecer las capacidades que les permitan educar para la ciudadanÃ­a, formando ciudadanos activos y crÃ­ticos, que respeten la diferencia, que conozcan y hagan uso de los mecanismos de participaciÃ³n para la transformaciÃ³n de sus comunidades y que resuelvan pacÃ­fica y constructivamente los conflictos y retos que les plantea la sociedad en su rol como ciudadanos de su vida, de su comunidad y del mundo.

El diseÃ±o de este curso fue realizado en el marco de la segunda fase del SREDECC (Sistema Regional de EvaluaciÃ³n y Desarrollo de Competencias Ciudadanas), un escenario latinoamericano de cooperaciÃ³n tÃ©cnica, financiado por el Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) y operado por la FundaciÃ³n Antonio Restrepo Barco.  En su segunda fase fue liderado por los Ministerios de EducaciÃ³n de Costa Rica, Colombia y MÃ©xico.","14,436",435
